A project of the [Medienkontrollzentrum](https://medienkontrollzentrum.com), open to public debate. The idea was to create an universal keyboard shortcut standard for Western Latin UTF-8 characters, based on the U.S. standard keyboard layout, to improve typing skills and ease international communication.

You get a total of 902 characters: 785 letters + 117 symbols and numbers. It supports over 30 languages with only one keyboard and is easy to remember !

Using a standard U.S. keyboard when programming gives you some advantages over country specific keyboards. The typical characters used can be accessed much easier. But there is a catch - when you correspond in a non English language, you miss certain characters used in some languages like: **à** or **ä**

I took a closer look on the Latin characters used in Europe, and developed a key system that enables your keyboard to access many special characters by the touch of only two extra keys. I tried to avoid key combinations used in programming languages and also make it simple, logical, and easy to remember.

**kînus** includes all letters used in the following languages:

* Croatian
* Czech
* Dansk
* Dutch
* Esperanto
* Estonian
* Finish
* French
* German
* Hungarian
* Icelandic
* Irish
* Kikuyu
* Latvian
* Livonian
* Lithuanian
* Maltese
* Northern Sami
* Norwegen
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Slovak
* Slovenian
* Swedisch
* Spanish
* Turkish
* Welsh

… and many more using the same letters. It also includes extra characters you might find usefull.

### Conclusion

If you are using an U.S. Standard Keyboard, and need to get those special WESTERN LATIN UTF-8 Characters – kînus may be for you. The Autohotkey Application (EXE) is free, enjoy. Latest version for Windows is 4.3.2.

Autohotkey is only used to demonstate the functional capability of the idea behind <strong>kînus</strong>. Integration should take place on the OS-Level.

Please contact me for errors that you have noticed, also please let me know what other languages you would like. Maybe it resolves the Misk section.
