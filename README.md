kînus - a project of the Medienkontrollzentrum, open to public debate. The idea was to create an universal keyboard shortcut standard for letters with diacritics, like ò, ó, ô, ǒ, ö, ő, ȍ, ø, and other symbols, like: ¡ ¿ £ € « … ». Based on the U.S. standard keyboard layout, you gain access to 927 Western Latin UTF-8 Characters, 810 letters and 117 symbols.

I took a closer look on the Latin characters used in Europe, and developed a key system that enables your keyboard to access many special characters & letters by the touch of only two extra keys. I tried to avoid key combinations used in programming languages and also make it simple, logical, and easy to remember.

kînus gives you intuitive access to Grave, Circumflex, Tilde & Co:

Conclusion

If you are using an U.S. Standard Keyboard, and need to get those special WESTERN LATIN UTF-8 Characters – kînus may be for you. The Autohotkey Application (EXE) is free, enjoy. Latest version for Windows is 5.2.

Autohotkey is only used to demonstate the functional capability of the idea behind kînus. Integration should take place on the OS-Level.

Please contact me for errors that you have noticed, also please let me know what other languages you would like, or are already covered by kînus and are not listed here. Maybe it resolves the Misk section.
